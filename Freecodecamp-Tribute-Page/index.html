                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Nikola Tesla (Serbo-Croatian: 10 July 1856, 7 January 1943)</strong> was a Serbian American inventor,
                    electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions
                    to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in
                    the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
                    Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would
                    become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City
                    before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set
                    up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His
                    alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric
                    in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system
                    which that company would eventually market.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
                    mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built
                    a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
                    would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
                    showmanship at public lectures.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power
                    distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs.
                    In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla
                    tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental
                    wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying
                    degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
                    behind unpaid bills. Tesla died in New York City in January 1943. His work fell into relative obscurity
                    following his death, but in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of
                    magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla
                    since the 1990s.</p>

                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan, Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present
                    day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819 - 1879),was an Eastern
                    Orthodox priest.Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla, whose father was also an Orthodox priest,had a talent for
                    making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka
                    had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his
                    mother's genetics and influence.Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.</p>

                <p>Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and an older brother
                    named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended
                    primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family
                    moved to the nearby Gospic, Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary
                    school, followed by middle school.</p>

                <p>In 1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium. The classes
                    were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.Tesla's father,
                    Milutin, was an Orthodox priest in the village of Smiljan</p>

                <p>Tesla would later write that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.
                    Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this
                    <em>mysterious phenomena</em> made him want
                    <em>to know more of this wonderful force</em>. Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which
                    prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating
                    in 1873.</p>

                <p>In 1873, Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine
                    months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, (who had originally
                    wanted him to enter the priesthood) promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered
                    from the illness.</p>

                <p>In 1874, Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of
                    Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla said that
                    this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in
                    Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier
                    illness.
                </p>

                <p>In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Frontier scholarship. During
                    his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly
                    twice as many as required), started a Serb cultural club, and even received a letter of commendation
                    from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated,
                    <em>Your son is a star of first rank.</em> During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor
                    Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators were not necessary.</p>

                <p>Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.He was
                    <em>mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.</em>
                    After his father's death in 1879, Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless
                    he were removed from the school, Tesla would die through overwork. At the end of his second year, Tesla
                    lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling. During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance
                    and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family.
                    Tesla said that he
                    <em>conquered [his] passion then and there,</em> but later in the U.S. he was again known to play billiards.
                    When examination time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied.
                    He did not receive grades for the last semester of the third year and he never graduated from the university.
                </p>

                <p>In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped
                    out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River. Tesla moved to Maribor,
                    where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local
                    men on the streets.</p>

                <p>In March 1879, Tesla's father went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but he refused. Nikola suffered
                    a nervous breakdown around the same time. On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospic under police
                    guard for not having a residence permit.</p>

                <p>On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness. Some sources
                    say that he died of a stroke. During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school
                    in Gospic.</p>

                <p>In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospic for Prague, where
                    he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied
                    Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however,
                    attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor and he did not receive grades for the courses.</p>
                </p>

                <h4>Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange</h4>
                <p>In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskas at a telegraph company, the Budapest
                    Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional,
                    so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest
                    Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During
                    his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected
                    a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.</p>

        <div id="Working At Edison" class="tabcontent">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>Working At Edison</h2>
                <p>In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working
                    in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in the form of
                    an electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique
                    Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system.
                    There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice
                    of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved
                    versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems
                    at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.</p>
                <h4>A move to the US</h4>
                <p>Tesla found the change from cosmopolitan Europe to working at this shop, located amongst the tenements on
                    Manhattan's lower east side, a
                    <em>painful surprise</em>.</p>
                <p>In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back
                    to the US to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and
                    asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States. He
                    began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded
                    shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20
                    <em>field engineers</em> struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As
                    in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard
                    Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Alva Edison only a couple of times. One of those
                    times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos
                    on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their
                    <em>Parisian</em> being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison
                    commented to Batchelor that
                    <em>this is a damned good man.</em> One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street
                    lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages
                    and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts
                    in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly
                    because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal
                    that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.</p>

                <p>Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. What event precipitated
                    his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators
                    or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over
                    unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison
                    Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design
                    <em>twenty-four different types of standard machines but it turned out to be a practical joke</em>. Later
                    versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping
                    <em>Tesla, you don't understand our American humor.</em>
                    The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and
                    the company did not have that amount of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary
                    contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the
                    two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying
                    <em>Good by to the Edison Machine Works</em>.

                <h2>Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing</h2>
                <p>Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,possibly the
                    same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the
                    same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.Serrell introduced Tesla to
                    two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and
                    utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light advanced Manufacturing.Tesla worked for the
                    rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued
                    to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained
                    notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.</p>

                <p>The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical
                    transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing
                    side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new
                    utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless.Tesla even lost control
                    of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He
                    had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla
                    would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing
                    <em>My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery</em>.</p>

                <h2>AC and Induction Motor</h2>
                <p> In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F.
                    Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial
                    gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they
                    agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric
                    Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3
                    to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street
                    in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and
                    other devices.</p>

                <p>In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that
                    was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage
                    transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the
                    motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented
                    in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking
                    and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.</p>

                <p>Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with
                    independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical
                    publications for articles to run concurrent with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony
                    (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla
                    to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers
                    working for the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that
                    Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system – something Westinghouse needed for the alternating
                    current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less,
                    rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888
                    by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.</p>

                <p>In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction
                    motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower
                    produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($54,500
                    in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company's
                    Pittsburgh labs.</p>

                <p>During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the
                    city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse
                    engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that
                    Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not
                    work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up
                    using a DC traction motor instead.</p>

                <h4>Market turmoil</h4>

                <p>Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both
                    in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse,
                    Edison, and Thompson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting
                    each other. There was even a
                    <em>War of Currents</em> propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current
                    system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market
                    meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the
                    related polyphase system right away.</p>

                <p>Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings
                    Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to W.E.
                    The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse
                    cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents,
                    including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract.At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been
                    unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty
                    even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were
                    even rarer.</p>

                <p>In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that,
                    if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric
                    and Tesla would have to
                    <em>deal with the bankers</em> to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse
                    continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company
                    from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's
                    patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric
                    (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thompson-Houston).</p>

                <h2>New York Laboratories</h2>
                <p>The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and
                    funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown
                    had rented and for the next dozen years would work out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.
                    These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889 - 1892), the fourth floor of 33 - 35 South Fifth Avenue
                    (1892 - 1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 and 48 East Houston Street (1895 - 1902). Tesla and
                    his hired staff would conduct some of his most significant work in these workshops.</p>
                <h4>Tesla coil</h4>

                <p>In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich
                    Hertz' 1886–88 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.
                    Tesla found this new discovery
                    <em>refreshing</em> and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments,
                    Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of
                    an improved arc lighting system but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and
                    melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla
                    came up with his Tesla coil with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary
                    windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.</p>

                <h4>Citizenship</h4>
                <p>On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented
                    his Tesla coil.</p>

                <h4>Wireless lighting</h4>

                <p>After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC
                    voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field
                    inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler
                    tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He would spend most of the decade working
                    on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures
                    succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.</p>

                <p>In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric
                    Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct
                    <em>intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires</em> by conducting
                    it through the Earth. Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers
                    from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).</p>

                <h4>Steam-powered oscillating generator</h4>

                <p>Trying to come up with a better way to generate alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating
                    electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition
                    that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing
                    a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at
                    high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the
                    wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but
                    never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.</p>

                <h4>Polyphase System and the Columbian Exposition</h4>

                <p>At the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress developing an efficient
                    version of Tesla's induction motor, and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete polyphase
                    AC system as the
                    <em>Tesla Polyphase System</em>. They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other
                    AC systems.</p>

                <p>Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where
                    the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won
                    the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC
                    power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of
                    a fully integrated alternating current system.Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to
                    alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously
                    performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating
                    current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.</p>

                <p>An observer noted:</p>

                <em>Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet
                    apart, and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned
                    on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended
                    plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These
                    were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous,
                    <em>where they produced so much wonder and astonishment</em>.</em>

                <p>Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating
                    how to make a copper egg stand on end, using a device that he constructed known as the
                    <em>Egg of Columbus</em> and introduced his new steam powered oscillator AC generator.</p>

                <h4>Consulting on Niagara</h4>

                <p>In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's
                    opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there
                    had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls.
                    Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage
                    DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing
                    systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was
                    a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded
                    a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls,
                    based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could
                    build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build
                    the AC distribution system.</p>

                <h4>The Nikola Tesla Company</h4>

                <p>In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the
                    Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions
                    as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The
                    board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s
                    was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market
                    never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.</p>

                <h4>Lab fire</h4>

                <p>In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught
                    fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and
                    collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a
                    collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that
                    had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times
                    <em>I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?</em>
                    After the fire Tesla moved to 46 and 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.</p>

                <h4>X-ray experimentation</h4>

                <p>In in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of
                    <em>invisible</em> kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later
                    identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-Rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode
                    electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks,
                    Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark
                    Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured
                    in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.[118] In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled
                    boat which he hoped to sell as a guided torpedo to navies around the world.</p>

                <p>In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla
                    proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum
                    tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil
                    (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation).
                    In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his
                    circuits, the
                    <em>instrument will enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary
                        apparatus.
                    </em>
                </p>

                <p>Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many
                    notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes.
                    He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated
                    in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays
                    were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in
                    force-free magnetic fields.</p>

                <p>On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event
                    that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute
                    particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it
                    passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his
                    <em>electric gun,</em> Tesla said,
                    <em>The particles in the beam of force will travel much faster than such particles and they will travel in
                        concentrations.
                    </em>
                </p>

                <h4>Radio remote control</h4>

                <p>In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed
                    <em>telautomaton</em>—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. The crowd that
                    witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy,
                    and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military
                    as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained
                    a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla
                    took the opportunity to further demonstrate
                    <em>Teleautomatics</em> in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling
                    to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.</p>

                <h2>Wireless Power</h2>
                <p>From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying
                    to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using
                    coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only
                    a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier
                    lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.</p>

                <p>At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication
                    signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on,
                    and came to the conclusion that part of existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new
                    form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to
                    die out in less than a mile.[132] Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were
                    totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of "invisible light" would diminish over
                    distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming
                    "hopelessly lost".</p>

                <p>By the mid 1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance
                    through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting
                    up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab.[134][135][136]
                    Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive,[137][138]
                    he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the
                    air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send
                    high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.</p>

                <h4>Colorado Springs</h4>

                <p>To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high
                    altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the
                    cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power
                    Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments he convinced John Jacob
                    Astor IV to invest $100,000 to become a majority share holder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought
                    he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund
                    his Colorado Springs experiments.[24][143] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct
                    wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.</p>

                <p>A multiple exposure picture of Tesla sitting next to his "magnifying transmitter" generating millions of
                    volts. The 7-metre (23 ft) long arcs were not part of the normal operation, but only produced for effect
                    by rapidly cycling the power switch.</p>

                <p>There he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning
                    (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet (41 m) long discharges and,at one point,
                    inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage.[147] The observations he made
                    of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to (incorrectly) conclude[148][149] that he could
                    use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.</p>

                <p>During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to
                    be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and
                    to the Red Cross Society in December 1900.[151][152] Reporters treated it as a sensational story and
                    jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in
                    a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article "Talking With Planets" where he said it had not been immediately
                    apparent to him that he was hearing "intelligently controlled signals" and that the signals could come
                    from Mars, Venus, or other planets.[152] It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo
                    Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in
                    a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from
                    another experimenter in wireless transmission.</p>

                <p>Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The
                    magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled
                    "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained
                    the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical
                    treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work,[154] illustrated with what were to
                    become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.</p>

                <h4>Wardenclyffe</h4>

                <p>Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904. From this facility, Tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless
                    transmission of electrical energy across the Atlantic. Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find
                    investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them
                    at the Waldorf-Astoria's Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and
                    Delmonico's.[155] In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($4,412,400 in today's dollars[73]) from J. Pierpont
                    Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe
                    Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore
                    of Long Island.</p>

                <p>By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's
                    radio based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own system. He approached Morgan to ask for
                    more money to build the larger system but Morgan refused to supply any further funds.[157] In December
                    1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in
                    the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's success, Tesla tried to
                    get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling "vibrations throughout
                    the globe".[151] Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan , pleading for
                    and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project
                    for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full 187 feet (57 m). In June 1902, Tesla
                    moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.</p>

                <p>Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began turning
                    against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the
                    financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was
                    a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at
                    the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($488,600 in today's dollars[73]).[160] He lost
                    the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the
                    land a more viable real estate asset.</p>

                <h2>Later years</h2>
                <p> After Wardencyiffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after "the great man" died, Tesla wrote to
                    Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165
                    Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went
                    on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth
                    Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street
                    from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents
                    had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.[161]</p>

                <h4>Bladeless turbine</h4>

                <p>Tesla's bladeless turbine design On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150
                    kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York,
                    several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.[162] Tesla worked with several
                    companies including the period 1919–1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis-Chalmers.[163][164] He spent
                    most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company,
                    but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device.[165] Tesla did license
                    the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and
                    other instruments.[166]</p>

                <h4>Wireless lawsuits</h4>

                <p>When World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in
                    order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German
                    wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company
                    Telefunken for patent infringement.[167] Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl
                    Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The
                    case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.[167][168] In 1915,
                    Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi's
                    initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements
                    to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the
                    grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents.[169][130][170]
                    Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere,[171] but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the
                    US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored
                    the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla.[172] The court declared that their decision
                    had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's
                    claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on
                    those same patents.[173][130]</p>

                <h4>Nobel Prize rumors</h4>

                <p>On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded
                    to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the
                    prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg "for their services
                    in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays."[174][175][176] There were unsubstantiated rumors
                    at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize.[174] The Nobel Foundation said, "Any rumor
                    that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the
                    reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.[174]
                    There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients
                    and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to
                    minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award
                    if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy
                    Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.[174][21] In the years after these
                    rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in
                    1915 and Tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937).[177]</p>

                <h4>Other ideas, awards, and patents</h4>

                <p>Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include: </p>
                Order of St. Sava, II Class, Government of Serbia (1892) Elliott Cresson Medal (1894)[178] Order of Prince Danilo I (1895)
                AIEE Edison Medal (1917).[179] Order of St. Sava, I Class, Government of Yugoslavia (1926)[180] Order of
                the Yugoslav Crown (1931) John Scott Medal (1934)[178] Order of the White Eagle, I Class, Government of Yugoslavia
                (1936)[181] Order of the White Lion, I Class, Government of Czechoslovakia (1937)[181] University of Paris
                Medal (1937) The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida, Sofia, Bulgaria (1939)

                <p>Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900 Tesla
                    Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different
                    types of oils to make a therapeutic gel.[182] He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years
                    later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.[183]</p>

                <p>Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted
                    "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," wiring the walls
                    of a schoolroom and, "saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high
                    frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating
                    electromagnetic field or 'bath.'"[184]The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent
                    of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.[184]

                    <p>Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he
                        was receiving from his patents in European countries. In the August 1917 edition of the magazine
                        Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via
                        using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed
                        on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern
                        radar).[185] Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate
                        water.[186] Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in
                        1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was
                        correct. Girardeau said, "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means
                        of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly."[187]
                        In 1928, Tesla received U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL
                        aircraft) and then of being "gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices" in flight
                        until it was flying like a conventional plane.[188] Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than
                        $1,000,[189] although the aircraft has been described as impractical.[190] This would be his last
                        patent and at this time Tesla closed his last office at 350 Madison Ave., which he had moved into
                        two years earlier.</p>

                    <h4>Living circumstances</h4>

                    <p>Since 1900, Tesla had been living at the Waldorf Astoria in New York running up a large bill.[191] In
                        1922, he moved to St. Regis Hotel and would follow a pattern from then on of moving to a new hotel
                        every few years leaving behind unpaid bills.[192][193]</p>

                    <p>Tesla would walk to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He took to feeding them at the window of
                        his hotel room and bringing the injured ones in to nurse back to health.[193][194][195] He said that
                        he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily. Tesla spent over $2,000, including
                        building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing
                        and leg.[32] Tesla stated:</p>

                    <em>I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white
                        with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and
                        call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved
                        me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.[196]</em>

                    <p>Tesla's unpaid bills, and complaints about the mess from his pigeon-feeding, forced him to leave the
                        St. Regis in 1923, the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930, and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934.[193] At
                        one point, he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.[197] In 1934, Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker,
                        and Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 per month as well as paying
                        his rent, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life. Accounts of how this came
                        about vary. Several sources say Westinghouse was worried (or warned) about potential bad publicity
                        surrounding the impoverished conditions under which their former star inventor was living.[198][199][200][201]
                        The payment has been described as being couched as a "consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion
                        to accept charity, or by one biographer (Marc Seifer) as a type of unspecified settlement.</p>

                    <h4>Birthday press conferences</h4>

                    <p>In 1931, Kenneth Swezey, a young writer who had been associated with Tesla for some time, organized a
                        celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than
                        70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein,[202] and he was also featured
                        on the cover of Time magazine.[203] The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his
                        contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual
                        event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink (featuring dishes of his
                        own creation) and invite the press to see his inventions and hear stories about past exploits, views
                        on current events, or sometimes odd or baffling claims.</p>

                    <p>At the 1932 occasion, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.[205] In 1933,
                        at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, he was on the verge of producing
                        proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was "violently opposed"
                        to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last
                        500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio
                        wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina
                        to record thought.</p>

                    <p>At the 1934 party, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He
                        would call it "teleforce", but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla described it as a
                        defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking
                        ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during
                        his lifetime, but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise,
                        The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described
                        an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging
                        slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic
                        repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union,
                        and Yugoslavia in the device.</p>

                    <p>In 1935, at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic
                        ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about
                        his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within
                        two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46
                        East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in downtown New York City in 1898. He went on to
                        tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure.
                        He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called "Telegeodynamics",
                        using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be
                        used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.
                    </p>

                    <p>At his 1937 celebration in the Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker, Tesla received the "Order of the White
                        Lion" from the Czechoslovakia ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslavian ambassador.[205] On questions
                        concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated
                        and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."</p>

                    <p>In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute
                        to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks
                        from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back
                        was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries
                        were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.</p>

                <h2>Patents</h2>
                <p>
                    Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various
                    sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known
                    patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain,
                    and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed
                    by Tesla were not put into patent protection.
